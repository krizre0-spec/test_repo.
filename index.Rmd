# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents.
Make sure you "knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors.
Hashtags are how we make section levels of a doc.

## Next level 

### Next level 

#### Next level 

# Basic formatting 

This is **bold** (double astericks). Or *italics*. or `code`.  

- this is the start of a list. 
- next item. 
- next item. make sure to have a space at the end of the line.  

1. this is a numbered list. 
2. second item. 

To add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)`without backticks. For example, [go here](https://www.sewanee.edu) 

To link sections of your document, do `[link text](#section name)`, without backticks. For example [go here](#markdown). 

To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this: "&nbsp;" w/o qoutes

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should be more space now. 

**To include an image -- fun!**
first put an image inside the folder where your `Rmd` file is located.
Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width = "50%"}

#RMarkdown

`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in. 

You can do R stuff in the same line as text. For example `r 3+3` will show as 6. 
(It would look like backtick lower case r space then code then backtick). 

You can also do a full multi-line CHUNK of R stuff:

```{r chunk-name }
#```{r}
3+3
#```
```

**Settings to control how R chunks appear:**

-`eval = TRUE`: which actualy runs the code, if `FALSE` then it shows the code but doesn't run it. 

-`echo = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, then the code can run without being seen.

-`warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warnings

-`fig.cap="figure caption` adds a figure caption

-`fig.width=7` example of figure width

-`fig.height=4` example of figure height
```{r, eval=FALSE}
3+3
#shown but not evaluated- good to use for troubleshooting
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#This will be evaluated but not shown- behind the scenes coding
4+4
```

#Bringing in real data

To manually set working directory while building up markdown file just go to Session > Set working directory > Source file location

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy<-read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip=1)

```

```{r explore data, }
library (dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull (Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
energy %>% pull(`Country/area`) %>% unique
```

```{r}
# filter data
fenergy<- energy %>% 
  filter (`Country/area`=='United States of America (the)')
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
ggplot(fenergy,
       aes(x=Year, 
           y=as.numeric(`Electricity statistics`), fill=Technology))+
  geom_area() 

```

# add more data
## this is fun :)
